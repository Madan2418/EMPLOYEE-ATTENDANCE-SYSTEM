# Employee Attendance System  

This **Java-based Employee Attendance System** helps organizations track employee attendance, manage records, and calculate payroll efficiently. It is built using **Java Swing** for the graphical user interface and **MySQL** for backend storage.  

## Features  

### üìå **Employee Management**  
- Add new employees with details such as **name, position, base salary, and hire date**.  
- Retrieve a list of all employees from the database.  

### üìå **Attendance Management**  
- Mark employees as **Present** in the attendance table.  
- Prevents duplicate attendance entries for the same employee on the same day.  
- Uses **JDBC** for database connectivity.  

### üìå **Payroll Calculation**  
- Calculates salary based on **days present** in a given month.  
- Stores payroll data and allows **updating salary records** if needed.  
- Employees can **view their payroll details** for any month.  

## Technology Stack  
- **Java** ‚Äì Core business logic and object-oriented structure.  
- **Swing** ‚Äì GUI framework for building the user interface.
