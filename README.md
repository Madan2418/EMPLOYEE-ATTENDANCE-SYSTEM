# Employee Attendance System  

This **Java-based Employee Attendance System** helps organizations track employee attendance, manage records, and calculate payroll efficiently. It is built using **Java Swing** for the graphical user interface and **MySQL** for backend storage.  

## Features  

### 📌 **Employee Management**  
- Add new employees with details such as **name, position, base salary, and hire date**.  
- Retrieve a list of all employees from the database.  

### 📌 **Attendance Management**  
- Mark employees as **Present** in the attendance table.  
- Prevents duplicate attendance entries for the same employee on the same day.  
- Uses **JDBC** for database connectivity.  

### 📌 **Payroll Calculation**  
- Calculates salary based on **days present** in a given month.  
- Stores payroll data and allows **updating salary records** if needed.  
- Employees can **view their payroll details** for any month.  

## Technology Stack  
- **Java** – Core business logic and object-oriented structure.  
- **Swing** – GUI framework for building the user interface.  
- **JDBC** – Database connectivity with MySQL.  
- **MySQL** – Stores employee, attendance, and payroll data.  

## Database Structure  
- **employees** – Stores employee details (`emp_id`, `name`, `position`, `base_salary`, `hire_date`).  
- **attendance** – Records daily attendance (`emp_id`, `date`, `status`).  
- **payroll** – Stores salary details (`emp_id`, `month`, `base_salary`, `total_salary`).  

## Installation & Setup  
1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Madan2418/EMPLOYEE-ATTENDANCE-SYSTEM.git
   ```  
2. **Setup MySQL Database**:  
   - Create a database named `hr_system`.  
   - Import the provided SQL schema file (`database.sql`).  

3. **Configure Database Connection**:  
   - Edit `DBConnection.java` with your MySQL credentials.  

4. **Run the Application:**  
   - Open the project in **IntelliJ, Eclipse, or NetBeans**.  
   - Compile and execute the `main` function in the GUI class.  

## Code Overview  

### 1️⃣ **Database Connection (`DBConnection.java`)**  
Handles MySQL database connectivity using JDBC.  

### 2️⃣ **Employee Management (`Employee.java`)**  
- Allows adding employees to the database.  
- Fetches a list of all employees.  

### 3️⃣ **Attendance System (`Attendance.java`)**  
- **Marks employees as present**.  
- Prevents marking duplicate attendance for the same day.  

### 4️⃣ **Payroll System (`Payroll.java`)**  
- Calculates salary based on present days in a month.  
- Saves payroll details and allows salary updates.
